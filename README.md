#Minesweeper Clone

A simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. This project replicates the basic functionality of the game, allowing users to reveal cells, flag mines, and win by clearing the grid without detonating any mines.

Features
Customizable Grid Sizes: Choose different grid sizes and mine counts.
Flag and Reveal: Mark suspected mines or reveal cells.
Win/Lose Conditions: Track game state to determine when the player wins or loses.
Recursive Clearing: Automatically reveal adjacent cells if no mines are nearby.
